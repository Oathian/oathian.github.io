                <h3>Backend Project</h3>
                <p>This was my first project, a restful API built with JavaScript in node, express, PostgresSQL and tested using Jest.</p>
                <p>The major challenge I faced with this project was with version control as this was the first time I had used the github branches feature. With practice however, I overcame these difficulties and have dealt with merge conflicts better in my later projects.</p>
                <p>I am pleased with how I handled my SQL database queries and table joins, before the project I would have thought these would have caused the most issues. I am also pleased with the way I wrote the test to check if a review is deleted.</p>

                <h3>Front Project</h3>
                <p>This project was a discussion board built in React using HTML, CSS and React hooks.</p>
                <p>There were a few challenges along the way most of them CSS based. I found it difficult to get the image and colour gradient of the background to work as I wanted though I got the desired result in the end.</p>
                <p>I really like the spinning loading sign and I think the design of the sorting menu looks neat considering how messy it could have been.</p>
